<h6>SECOND ACT - _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_</h6>

<P>You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well</P>
        
<h6 class= "name SIR ROBERT CHILTERN ">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
        
<P>When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my
    passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out,
    disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time
    for success.  I couldn’t wait</P>
            
    <h6 class= "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6>
            
    <p>Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
       still young.  No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
        Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
        enough for any one, I should think.</p>

    <p>And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?</p>5
                    
    <h6 class= "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                    
    <p>Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?</p>
                    
    <h6 class= "name SIR ROBERT CHILTERN ">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
                    
    <p class="stage_direction">[_Excitedly_.]</p>  
                    
    <p>I did not sell myself for money. I bought success at a great price. That is all.</p>
                        
    <h6 class= "name LORD GORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                        
    <p class="stage_direction">[_Gravely_.]  
                            
    <p>Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?</p>
                            
    <h6 class= "name SIR ROBERT CHILTERN ">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
                            
    <p>Baron Arnheim.</p>
