    <h6>SECOND ACT - _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_</h6>
    <p>
        
        <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                
        <p class="speech">You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well</p>
                
        <h6 class="name SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
                
        <p class="speech">When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my
            passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out,
            disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time
            for success.  I couldn’t wait</p>
                    
            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                    
            <p class="speech">Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
            still young.  No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
                Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
                enough for any one, I should think.</p>

            <p class="speech">And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?</p>
                            
            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                            
            <p class="speech">Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?</p>
                            
            <h6 class="name SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
                            
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Excitedly_.]</p>  
                            
            <p class="speech">I did not sell myself for money. I bought success at a great price. That is all.</p>
                                
            <h6 class="name LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h6>
                                
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Gravely_.]  </p>
                                    
            <p class="speech">Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?</p>
