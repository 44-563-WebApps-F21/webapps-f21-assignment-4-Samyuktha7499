    <h6>SECOND ACT - _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_</h6>
    <p1>LORD GORING.  You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth
        you could have succeeded just as well.<br>
        
        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my
        passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out,
        disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time
        for success.  I couldn’t wait.<br>
        
        LORD GORING.  Well, you certainly have had your success while you are
        still young.  No one in our day has had such a brilliant success.
        Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty—that’s good
        enough for any one, I should think.<br>
        
        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I lose
        everything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?<br>
        
        LORD GORING.  Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?<br>
        
        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Excitedly_.]  I did not sell myself for money.  I
        bought success at a great price.  That is all.<br>
        
        LORD GORING.  [_Gravely_.]  Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
        But what first made you think of doing such a thing?<br>
        
        SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Baron Arnheim.<br>
        
        LORD GORING.  Damned scoundrel!</p1>
